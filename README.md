My First Experience as a Game Develepor

Hello to all that reading this README :)

first thx a lot for the opportunity! rhat was my first assignment in the world of game development 
I learn a lot! and I really enjoy that :)

Just want be clear that i didn't sucssed to implement two thing:

1.Game debug menu-I didn't succeed to implement that I didn't find any resource about that.

2.Polling objecr- While starting my projrct I understand that this method is really importent for preformence of the game.
i Sucssed to impliment that but it wasn't smoothly at all so i Used the wasted costly instantiate.

I know it's not perfect by I tried my best 
thx a lot for the opportunity :)
